What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In this assignment, the main challenge was to understand what "object-oriented" means and how I can convert the procedural programming code (that I have been using so far) into object-oriented one. I had to recognize the same behaviors in procedural code and use classes and methods. 

What worked for me was focusing on practical responsibility. The main question I had to ask myself to decide which behavior is under which class was: which behavior belongs to one computer and which to the store? Once framed that way, I was able to see that things like storing details, updating price, etc. belongs to Computer, while buying, selling, keeping track, etc. to ResaleShop class.

At first, I though that object-oriented code has to look more complicated/ completely different from the procedural version. However, I was able to see how the same behavior is simply moved to classes and methods making it more clear and organized. Using attributes like computer.price rather than dictionary keys like computer["price"] feels more natural. 

Advice for someone taking this class is to do the mental work before the practica. Before coding straight away it is important to think about the design, behaviors, results, etc. In this assignment, if I started coding right away, I might have made mistakes in categorizing which behavior belongs to which class or translating from procedural to object-oriented code.
